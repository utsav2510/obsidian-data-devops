Tuples are similar to list but they are immutable i.e. can't be modified once constructed.

```python
tuple1 = (2,4,6)
```

Instead of square brackets (used in lists) tuples are defined using parenthesis.

Tuples can be unpacked like shown below:

```python
tuple1 = (2,4,6)
a,b,c = tuple1 #a=2, b=4, c=6
```

Elements can be accessed similar to that in the list

```python
x = tuple1[0]
print(x) #will print 2
```
