## Naming conventions of tables and fields
When it comes to naming SQL tables and fields, it is important to follow some best practices to ensure clarity and maintainability of the database structure. Here are some recommendations:
1. Use descriptive and meaningful names: Choose names that accurately describe the purpose or content of the table or field. Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms that may be unclear to others.
2. Be consistent: Establish a consistent naming convention throughout the database. This helps in easily understanding the relationships between tables and fields.
3. Use lowercase and underscores: It is common practice to use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words in table and field names. For example, "customer_orders" or "product_name".
4. Avoid reserved words: Be cautious not to use reserved words or keywords of the specific database system you are using. This can lead to conflicts and errors.
5. Be concise but not too short: Aim for concise names that convey the meaning, but avoid using overly short names that may be ambiguous or difficult to understand.
6. Use singular nouns for field names: Field names should typically be singular nouns, representing a single entity or concept. For example, "customer" instead of "customers".
7. Use plural nouns for Table names: Table names should generally be plural nouns, representing a collection of values related to the table. For example, "products" instead of "product".
