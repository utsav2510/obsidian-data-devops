## SQL Select Query Order of Execution

When executing a SQL SELECT query, the database engine follows a specific order of execution to retrieve the desired data. The order of execution is as follows:

1. FROM clause: The FROM clause specifies the table or tables from which the data will be retrieved.

2. WHERE clause: The WHERE clause filters the data based on specified conditions.

3. GROUP BY clause: The GROUP BY clause groups the data based on specified columns.

4. HAVING clause: The HAVING clause filters the grouped data based on specified conditions.

5. SELECT clause: The SELECT clause selects the columns to be included in the result set.

6. ORDER BY clause: The ORDER BY clause sorts the result set based on specified columns.

7. LIMIT clause: The LIMIT clause limits the number of rows returned in the result set.

It is important to note that not all clauses are required in every SELECT query. The order of execution may vary depending on the specific query and its requirements.
