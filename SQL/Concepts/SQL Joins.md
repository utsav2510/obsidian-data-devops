## Various types of SQL JOINS
In SQL, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of SQL joins:

1. Inner Join: Returns only the matching rows from both tables.

2. Left Join (or Left Outer Join): Returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for the right table.

3. Right Join (or Right Outer Join): Returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for the left table.

4. Full Join (or Full Outer Join): Returns all the rows from both tables. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for the non-matching rows.

5. Cross Join (or Cartesian Join): Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, resulting in a combination of every row from the first table with every row from the second table.

Each type of join serves a different purpose and can be used based on the specific requirements of the query.

It is important to note that the syntax for joins may vary slightly depending on the database management system (DBMS) being used.
