**Mutable infrastructure** are those resources which can be changed without deleting them.

**Immutable Infrastructure** are those resources which are deleted and recreated when there is a need to update them. Immutability makes it easier for code versioning. Eg: Changing file permission will delete and create a new local file.

Lifecycle blocks are added inside [[Resource Block]].
